# C
I took C lessons from youtube to better understand what programming languages are and their concepts.

At the C Projects folder you can see the little projects from C Lessons.

In the other folder, C lessons, there is what I learned in the lessons.

Note: I did not have any software background and infrastructure while taking these courses. That's why the C courses were a guide to programming basics.
